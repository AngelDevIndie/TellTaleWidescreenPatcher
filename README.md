# TellTale Widescreen Patcher
This program patches your telltale games to run in 21:9! No more "cinematic" black bars all over your screen.  

# Instructions
Simply run the program, browse to the executable for your TellTale game, and click Patch!  
If you get an error, your game is not supported. Please open an issue and tell me the game you tried & where you got it from (GOG/Steam). 

# Tested Titles 
Game Name | Issues
----------- | -----------
Batman The Enemy Within - The Telltale Series | Works 100%  
Batman - The Telltale Series | Two black bars on the top and bottom in the middle of the screen  
The Walking Dead The Final Season | Works but I haven't played much yet
The Walking Dead - A New Frontier | Works
Tales from the Borderlands | Does not work, use Flawless Widescreen
