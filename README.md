# TellTale Widescreen Patcher
This program patches your telltale games to run in 21:9! No more "cinematic" black bars all over your screen.  

# Instructions
Simply run the program, browse to the executable for your TellTale game, and click Patch!  
If you get an error, your game is not supported. Please open an issue and tell me the game you tried & where you got it from (GOG/Steam).

**Make sure you run the game and select your resolution before patching.**
